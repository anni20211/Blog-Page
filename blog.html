                Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us
                would
                reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a
                website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of
                front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!

                    However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end
                    design
                    and web development.

                        <h2>Commenting</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes
                            that
                            are written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of
                            project
                            you create. With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to
                            jump
                            in and understand where things are at and how they work.

                        <h2>Invest In Productive Tools.</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart
                            plugins, the amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really
                            productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like
                            Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for
                            web
                            developers.

                        <p>
                            A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news
                            and
                            innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about
                            front-end development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most
                            informative and useful learning sources for front-end developers -

                        <p>
                            Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These meet-ups provide excellent
                            opportunities to expand your network and get acquainted with talented people.

                        <h2>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its
                            functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the
                            more
                            often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of
                            what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring
                            offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.</p>

                        <h2>Automate!</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can
                            get
                            overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing,
                            workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on.
                            Doesn’t sound easy, right?
                            <br>

                            Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation
                            can
                            take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
                            front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the
                            user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you
                            will
                            also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality
                            of
                            your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.
